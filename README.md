# DocumentsClasification
I have implemented Naive Bayes and SVM using SKlearn for DocumentsClasification by following http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html

# DataSet

Dataset that is used called  20 newsgroups dataset  Here is the official description, quoted from the website (http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/):

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of our knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his paper “Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews,” though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.
